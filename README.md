# Natural Language Processing on a Hotel Reviews Dataset (Part 1)
The aim of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing on a hotels review dataset provided by the BrainStation team. Due to the datatset being very large, I sampled and worked with only 10% of it. I performed feature engineering and used Count Vectorizer to transform the positive and negative reviews into a numeric dataset.
